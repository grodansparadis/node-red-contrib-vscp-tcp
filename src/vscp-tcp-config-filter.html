    <p>Define a VSCP event filter for a connection.
    A VSCP event filter makes it possible to only receive a
    subset of the events that flows through an interface. It is
    possible to filter events on priority, VSCP class, VSCP type 
    and GUID.</p>
    <p>All values can be entered as decimal, hexadecimal, octal or binary 
    values. A hexadecimal, octal value or a binary value should be 
    preceded by '0x', '0o' respectively '0b'.</p>

    <h3>Name</h3>
        <dl class="message-properties">
            Set the name to a useful description of the filter.
        </dl>

    <h3>Priority</h3>
        <dl class="message-properties">
            Makes it possible to filter out events with a specific priority.
            Highest priority is 0 and lowest is 7. Set mask to all ones (7) and

     <h3>VSCP Class</h3>
        <dl class="message-properties">        
            Makes it possible to filter out events with a specific VSCP class.
            A VSCP class is value in the range 0-512 for a Level I event and 0-65535 
            for a level II event. Set mask to all ones (0xffff) and

    <h3>VSCP Type</h3>
        <dl class="message-properties">        
            Makes it possible to filter out events with a specific VSCP type.
            A VSCP type has a value in the range 0-255 for a Level I event and 0-65535 
            for a level II event. Set mask to all ones (0xffff) and
            filter to the wanted VSCP type to receive only events with that 
            specific VSCP type.

            <dt>Filter<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
            <dd> 
                Filter for VSCP type. A VSCP type is value in the range 0-255 for a 
                Level I event and 0-65535 for a level II event. 
            </dd>
            
            <dt>Mask<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>

    <h3>VSCP GUID</h3>
        <dl class="message-properties">

            <dd> 
                Filter for GUID. A GUID is entered on the form
                00:01:02:03:04:05:06:07:08:09:0a:0b:0c:0d:0e:0f where each
                colon separated digit pair is a hexadecimal value with the mask_priority
                significant byte in the first position. Together (16 bytes) they form a 
                128-bit unique number that is used in VSCP as an id for devices.
            </dd>
            
            <dt>Mask<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
            <dd> 
                Mask for GUID. The mask should be entered on the same for as the filter. 
                Set to all zeros for a don't care (00:00:00....) and to all ones (ff:ff:ff...)
                to receive only events with a specific GUID set in the GUID filter.
            </dd>     
        </dl>  

    <h3>Details</h3>
        <p>The filter object consist of pairs of filter-bits and 
        mask-bits. The mask-bits tell which bits of the filter-bits that 
        should be checked (and have the same value as the events bit at that position) 
        when the event filter is evaluated.</p>
        <p>If you for example just want to receive a specific VSCP class  
        you set that class in the vscp_class_filter and set all bits in the 
        corresponding VSCP class mask_to all ones.</p>
        <p>Generally a mask should have a one in a bit position at the same 
        place as a bit in the filter has the required value for that bit. Setting
        a bit position to zero in the mask is therefore a don't care for that bit
        position.</p>
